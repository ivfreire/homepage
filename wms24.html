					<h2>1. Introduction</h2><br>
					<p>This study explores the applications of computer graphics technology for the real-time visualization of deep borehole repositories for radioactive waste disposal. Through these sophisticated graphical representations, we seek to enhance the comprehension and evaluation of the safety and efficacy of deep geological disposal solutions, contributing to the scientific discourse on sustainable radioactive waste management strategies.</p>

					<h3>1.1 Disused Sealed Radioactive Sources (DSRS)</h3><br>
					<p>DSRS are radioactive materials that were once active for use in various applications, such as medical treatments, industrial processes, or scientific research, but are no longer needed or in use. These sources remain sealed in their original containment to prevent the spread of radiation, but they require careful handling, storage, and disposal due to their potential environmental and health hazards.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					<h3>1.2 Deep Borehole Concept (DBC)</h3><br>
					<p>The DBC disposal for radioactive waste involves drilling deep holes into stable geological formations, typically 3 to 5 kilometers below the Earth's surface, to isolate and dispose of high-level radioactive waste. This method is considered for its potential to securely contain and isolate radioactive materials from the biosphere for millions of years, leveraging the natural geological barriers to prevent the migration of radionuclides..</p>

					<h3>1.3 Computer Graphics (CG)</h3><br>
					<p>CG is the technology and art of creating and manipulating visual content on computers. It includes generating images, animations, and visual effects for various applications like video games, movies, and simulations.</p>

					<h2>2. Objectives</h2><br>
					<p><b>2.1.</b> Investigate & identify the potential applications of CG tech in the radioactive waste management industry.</p><br>
					<p><b>2.2.</b> Provide the industry with a tool for real-time visualization of DBC repositories for disposal of DSRS.</p><br>
					<p><b>2.3.</b> Enhance the general public understanding of the safety of geological repositories.</p>

					<h2>3. Methodology</h2><br>
					<p>In CG industry, there are multiples software tools that can be applied to the waste management industry in several ways. The development process in this study has been divided into the following steps:</p><br>
					<p><b>3.1.</b> Identify important characteristics & features of DBC repositories from IAEA Safety Standards documentation.</p><br>
					<p><b>3.2.</b> Create & develop visual resources (3D models, image textures, shaders) to virtually represent the physical structure and geological profiles of DBC repositories.</p><br>
					<p><b>3.3.</b> Final deployment of the developed resources into an interactive & distributable software product.</p><br>
					<p>The technologies elected for the purpuse of this work were Blender & Gotot Engine.</p><br>
					<p>Blender is an open-source software used for creating 3D content, including modeling, animation, and rendering. It's widely adopted by artists and designers for its comprehensive toolset and flexibility in various creative projects, from simple models to complex animations and visual effects.</p><br>
